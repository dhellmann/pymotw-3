signal -- Receive notification of asynchronous system events
============================================================

.. module:: signal
    :synopsis: Receive notification of asynchronous system events

:Purpose: Receive notification of asynchronous system events
:Available In: 1.4 and later

.. note::

    Programming with Unix signal handlers is a non-trivial endeavor. This is an introduction,
    and does not include all of the details you may need to use signals successfully on every
    platform. There is some degree of standardization across versions of Unix, but there is
    also some variation, so consult documentation for your OS if you run into trouble.

Signals are an operating system feature that provide a means of
notifying your program of an event, and having it handled
asynchronously.  They can be generated by the system itself, or sent
from one process to another.  Since signals interrupt the regular flow
of your program, it is possible that some operations (especially I/O)
may produce error if a signal is received in the middle.

Signals are identified by integers and are defined in the operating
system C headers.  Python exposes the signals appropriate for the
platform as symbols in the :mod:`signal` module.  For the examples
below, I will use ``SIGINT`` and ``SIGUSR1``.  Both are typically
defined for all Unix and Unix-like systems.

Receiving Signals
=================

As with other forms of event-based programming, signals are received
by establishing a callback function, called a *signal handler*, that
is invoked when the signal occurs.  The arguments to your signal
handler are the signal number and the stack frame from the point in
your program that was interrupted by the signal.

.. include:: signal_signal.py
    :literal:
    :start-after: #end_pymotw_header

This relatively simple example script loops indefinitely, pausing for
a few seconds each time.  When a signal comes in, the sleep call is
interrupted and the signal handler ``receive_signal()`` prints the
signal number.  When the signal handler returns, the loop continues.

To send signals to the running program, I use the command line program
kill.  To produce the output below, I ran ``signal_signal.py`` in one
window, then ``kill -USR1 $pid``, ``kill -USR2 $pid``, and ``kill -INT
$pid`` in another.

getsignal()
===========

To see what signal handlers are registered for a signal, use
:func:`getsignal()`.  Pass the signal number as argument.  The return
value is the registered handler, or one of the special values
``signal.SIG_IGN`` (if the signal is being ignored),
``signal.SIG_DFL`` (if the default behavior is being used), or
``None`` (if the existing signal handler was registered from C, rather
than Python).

.. include:: signal_getsignal.py
    :literal:
    :start-after: #end_pymotw_header

Again, since each OS may have different signals defined, the output
you see from running this on other systems may vary.  This is from OS
X:

    $ python signal_getsignal.py

Sending Signals
===============

The function for sending signals is ``os.kill()``.  Its use is covered
in the section on the :mod:`os` module,
:ref:`creating-processes-with-os-fork`.

Alarms
======

Alarms are a special sort of signal, where your program asks the OS to
notify it after some period of time has elapsed.  As `the standard
module documentation for os
<http://docs.python.org/lib/node545.html>`_ points out, this is useful
for avoiding blocking indefinitely on an I/O operation or other system
call.

.. include:: signal_alarm.py
    :literal:
    :start-after: #end_pymotw_header

In this example, the call to :func:`sleep()` does not last the full 4
seconds.

::

    $ python signal_alarm.py
    Before: Sun Aug 17 10:51:09 2008
    Alarm : Sun Aug 17 10:51:11 2008
    After : Sun Aug 17 10:51:11 2008


Ignoring Signals
================

To ignore a signal, register ``SIG_IGN`` as the handler.  This script
replaces the default handler for ``SIGINT`` with ``SIG_IGN``, and
registers a handler for ``SIGUSR1``.  Then it uses
:func:`signal.pause()` to wait for a signal to be received.

.. include:: signal_ignore.py
    :literal:
    :start-after: #end_pymotw_header

Normally ``SIGINT`` (the signal sent by the shell to your program when
you hit Ctrl-C) raises a :ref:`KeyboardInterrupt
<exceptions-KeyboardInterrupt>`.  In this example, we ignore ``SIGINT``
and raise :ref:`SystemExit <exceptions-SystemExit>` when we see
``SIGUSR1``.  Each ``^C`` represents an attempt to use Ctrl-C to kill
the script from the terminal.  Using ``kill -USR1 72598`` from another
terminal eventually causes the script to exit.

::

    $ python signal_ignore.py 
    My PID: 72598
    ^C^C^C^CExiting


Signals and Threads
===================

Signals and threads don't generally mix well because only the main
thread of a process will receive signals.  The following example sets
up a signal handler, waits for the signal in one thread, and sends the
signal from another.

.. include:: signal_threads.py
    :literal:
    :start-after: #end_pymotw_header

Notice that the signal handlers were all registered in the main
thread.  This is a requirement of the signal module implementation for
Python, regardless of underlying platform support for mixing threads
and signals.  Although the receiver thread calls
:func:`signal.pause()`, it does not receive the signal.  The
``signal.alarm(2)`` call near the end of the example prevents an
infinite block, since the receiver thread will never exit.

::

    $ python signal_threads.py 
    Waiting for signal in <Thread(receiver, started)>
    Sending signal in <Thread(sender, started)>
    Received signal 30 in <_MainThread(MainThread, started)>
    Waiting for <Thread(receiver, started)>
    Alarm clock

Although alarms can be set in threads, they are also received by the
main thread.

.. include:: signal_threads_alarm.py
    :literal:
    :start-after: #end_pymotw_header

Notice that the alarm does not abort the :func:`sleep()` call in
:func:`use_alarm()`.

::

    $ python signal_threads_alarm.py
    Sun Aug 17 12:06:00 2008 Setting alarm in <Thread(alarm_thread, started)>
    Sun Aug 17 12:06:00 2008 Sleeping in <Thread(alarm_thread, started)>
    Sun Aug 17 12:06:00 2008 Waiting for <Thread(alarm_thread, started)>;
    Sun Aug 17 12:06:03 2008 Done with sleep
    Sun Aug 17 12:06:03 2008 Alarm in <_MainThread(MainThread, started)>
    Sun Aug 17 12:06:03 2008 Exiting normally

        The :func:`kill()` function can be used to send signals
        between processes.

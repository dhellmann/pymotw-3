StringIO and cStringIO -- Work with text buffers using file-like API
====================================================================

.. module:: StringIO
    :synopsis: Work with text buffers using file-like API

.. module:: cStringIO
    :synopsis: Work with text buffers using file-like API

:Purpose: Work with text buffers using file-like API
:Available In: StringIO: 1.4, cStringIO: 1.5

:class:`StringIO` provides a convenient means of working with text in
memory using the file API (read, write. etc.). There are two separate
implementations. The :mod:`cStringIO` version is written in C for
speed, while :mod:`StringIO` is written in Python for
portability. Using :mod:`cStringIO` to build large strings can offer
performance savings over some other string conctatenation techniques.

Example
=======

Here are some pretty standard, simple, examples of using
:class:`StringIO` buffers:

.. include:: stringio_examples.py
    :literal:
    :start-after: #end_pymotw_header

This example uses :func:`read()`, but the :func:`readline()` and
:func:`readlines()` methods are also available. The :class:`StringIO`
class also provides a :func:`seek()` method so it is possible to jump
around in a buffer while reading, which can be useful for rewinding if
you are using some sort of look-ahead parsing algorithm.

.. {{{cog
.. cog.out(run_script(cog.inFile, 'stringio_examples.py'))
.. }}}

::

	$ python stringio_examples.py
	
	This goes into the buffer. And so does this.
	
	Inital value for read buffer

.. {{{end}}}

Real world applications of :mod:`StringIO` include a web application
stack where various parts of the stack may add text to the response,
or testing the output generated by parts of a program which typically
write to a file.

The application we are building at work includes a shell scripting
interface in the form of several command line programs. Some of these
programs are responsible for pulling data from the database and
dumping it on the console (either to show the user, or so the text can
serve as input to another command). The commands share a set of
formatter plugins to produce a text representation of an object in a
variety of ways (XML, bash syntax, human readable, etc.). Since the
formatters normally write to standard output, testing the results
would be a little tricky without the StringIO module. Using StringIO
to intercept the output of the formatter gives us an easy way to
collect the output in memory to compare against expected results.

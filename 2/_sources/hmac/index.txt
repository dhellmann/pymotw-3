hmac -- Cryptographic signature and verification of messages.
=============================================================

.. module:: hmac
    :synopsis: Cryptographic signature and verification of messages.

:Purpose: 
    The hmac module implements keyed-hashing for message authentication, as
    described in :rfc:`2104`.
:Available In: 2.2

The HMAC algorithm can be used to verify the integrity of information
passed between applications or stored in a potentially vulnerable
location. The basic idea is to generate a cryptographic hash of the
actual data combined with a shared secret key. The resulting hash can
then be used to check the transmitted or stored message to determine a
level of trust, without transmitting the secret key.

Disclaimer: I'm not a security expert. For the full details on HMAC,
check out :rfc:`2104`.

Example
=======

Creating the hash is not complex. Here's a simple example which uses
the default MD5 hash algorithm:

.. include:: hmac_simple.py
    :literal:
    :start-after: #end_pymotw_header

When run, the code reads its source file and computes an HMAC
signature for it:

.. {{{cog
.. cog.out(run_script(cog.inFile, 'hmac_simple.py'))
.. }}}

::

	$ python hmac_simple.py
	
	4bcb287e284f8c21e87e14ba2dc40b16

.. {{{end}}}

.. note::

   If I haven't changed the file by the time I release the example
   source for this week, the copy you download should produce the same
   hash.

SHA vs. MD5
===========

Although the default cryptographic algorithm for :mod:`hmac` is MD5,
that is not the most secure method to use. MD5 hashes have some
weaknesses, such as collisions (where two different messages produce
the same hash). The SHA-1 algorithm is considered to be stronger, and
should be used instead.

.. include:: hmac_sha.py
    :literal:
    :start-after: #end_pymotw_header

``hmac.new()`` takes 3 arguments. The first is the secret key, which
should be shared between the two endpoints which are communicating so
both ends can use the same value. The second value is an initial
message. If the message content that needs to be authenticated is
small, such as a timestamp or HTTP POST, the entire body of the
message can be passed to ``new()`` instead of using the update()
method. The last argument is the digest module to be used. The default
is ``hashlib.md5``. The previous example substitutes ``hashlib.sha1``.

.. cog.out(run_script(cog.inFile, 'hmac_sha.py'))
.. }}}

Binary Digests
==============

The first few examples used the ``hexdigest()`` method to produce
printable digests. The hexdigest is is a different representation of
the value calculated by the ``digest()`` method, which is a binary
value that may include unprintable or non-ASCII characters, including
NULs. Some web services (Google checkout, Amazon S3) use the
``base64`` encoded version of the binary digest instead of the
hexdigest.

.. include:: hmac_base64.py
    :literal:
    :start-after: #end_pymotw_header

The base64 encoded string ends in a newline, which frequently needs to be
stripped off when embedding the string in HTTP headers or other
formatting-sensitive contexts.

.. cog.out(run_script(cog.inFile, 'hmac_base64.py'))

Applications
============

HMAC authentication should be used for any public network service, and
any time data is stored where security is important. For example, when
sending data through a pipe or socket, that data should be signed and
then the signature should be tested before the data is used. The
extended example below is available in the ``hmac_pickle.py`` file as
part of the PyMOTW source package.

First, let's establish a function to calculate a digest for a string,
and a simple class to be instantiated and passed through a
communication channel.

::

    import hashlib
    import hmac
    try:
        import cPickle as pickle
    except:
        import pickle
    import pprint
    from StringIO import StringIO


    def make_digest(message):
        "Return a digest for the message."
        return hmac.new('secret-shared-key-goes-here', message, hashlib.sha1).hexdigest()


    class SimpleObject(object):
        "A very simple class to demonstrate checking digests before unpickling."
        def __init__(self, name):
            self.name = name
        def __str__(self):
            return self.name

Next, create a :mod:`StringIO` buffer to represent the socket or
pipe. We will using a naive, but easy to parse, format for the data
stream. The digest and length of the data are written, followed by a
new line. The serialized representation of the object, generated by
:mod:`pickle`, follows. In a real system, we would not want to depend
on a length value, since if the digest is wrong the length is probably
wrong as well. Some sort of terminator sequence not likely to appear
in the real data would be more appropriate.

For this example, we will write two objects to the stream. The first is
written using the correct digest value. 

::

    # Simulate a writable socket or pipe with StringIO
    out_s = StringIO()

    # Write a valid object to the stream:
    #  digest\nlength\npickle
    o = SimpleObject('digest matches')
    pickled_data = pickle.dumps(o)
    digest = make_digest(pickled_data)
    header = '%s %s' % (digest, len(pickled_data))
    print '\nWRITING:', header
    out_s.write(header + '\n')
    out_s.write(pickled_data)

The second object is written to the stream with an invalid digest, produced by
calculating the digest for some other data instead of the pickle.

::

    # Write an invalid object to the stream
    o = SimpleObject('digest does not match')
    pickled_data = pickle.dumps(o)
    digest = make_digest('not the pickled data at all')
    header = '%s %s' % (digest, len(pickled_data))
    print '\nWRITING:', header
    out_s.write(header + '\n')
    out_s.write(pickled_data)

    out_s.flush()


Now that the data is in the :mod:`StringIO` buffer, we can read it
back out again.  The first step is to read the line of data with the
digest and data length.  Then the remaining data is read (using the
length value). We could use ``pickle.load()`` to read directly from
the stream, but that assumes a trusted data stream and we do not yet
trust the data enough to unpickle it. Reading the pickle as a string
collect the data from the stream, without actually unpickling the
object.

::

    # Simulate a readable socket or pipe with StringIO
    in_s = StringIO(out_s.getvalue())

    # Read the data
    while True:
        first_line = in_s.readline()
        if not first_line:
            break
        incoming_digest, incoming_length = first_line.split(' ')
        incoming_length = int(incoming_length)
        print '\nREAD:', incoming_digest, incoming_length
        incoming_pickled_data = in_s.read(incoming_length)

Once we have the pickled data, we can recalculate the digest value and
compare it against what we read. If the digests match, we know it is
safe to trust the data and unpickle it.

::

        actual_digest = make_digest(incoming_pickled_data)
        print 'ACTUAL:', actual_digest

        if incoming_digest != actual_digest:
            print 'WARNING: Data corruption'
        else:
            obj = pickle.loads(incoming_pickled_data)
            print 'OK:', obj

The output shows that the first object is verified and the second is deemed
"corrupted", as expected:

.. {{{cog
.. cog.out(run_script(cog.inFile, 'hmac_pickle.py'))
.. }}}

 Cryptography
==============

Encryption secures messages so that they can be verified
as accurate and protected from interception.  Python's cryptography
support includes :mod:`hashlib` for generating signatures of message
content using standard algorithms such as MD5 and SHA, and :mod:`hmac`
for verifying that a message has not been altered in transmission.
